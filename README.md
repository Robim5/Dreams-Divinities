## 🌌 About

“Dreams: Divinities” invites you into a utopia where clouds, a radiant sun, beams of light, and musical notes float in a dream realm. Every mouse interaction gently shifts colors, opacities, and positions—uncovering new layers of meaning and emotion. A 4‑minute day/night cycle weaves a poetic rhythm, contrasting the serene daylight with the festive energy of night.
